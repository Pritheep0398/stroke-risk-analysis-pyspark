# Stroke Risk Analysis Using PySpark

This project analyzes healthcare data to predict the likelihood of stroke in patients based on various features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, and BMI. The analysis is implemented using Apache Spark (PySpark) for scalable data processing and is executed in **Google Colab.

## Project Goals

- Load and clean the healthcare dataset using PySpark
- Explore correlations between health features and stroke occurrence
- Build a stroke risk prediction logic using RDD transformations
- Visualize grouped outcomes where applicable

---
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of big data tools like PySpark in analyzing healthcare datasets for stroke prediction. By using RDD-based transformations, the analysis is scalable and flexible. This project serves as a foundation for more advanced machine learning models or real-world medical data applications.
